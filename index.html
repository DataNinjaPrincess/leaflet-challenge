<h1>Leaflet Challenge</h1>

<p>For this project, we were to visualize earthquake data for the USGS, with indicators for size (circumferance) and depth (color). The map links can be accessed below</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="Leaflet-Step-1/index.html">Simple map of earthquake locations</a></li>
  <li><strong><a href="Leaflet-Step-2/index.html">Map of earthquake locations with tectonic plate borders</a></li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting observation that I made is that while most of the earthquakes are located near the intersection of tectonic plates, there are a 
  number of quakes in the interior of the United Sates that are not near any of these lines.  A quick search showed that the quakes in the interior 
  rouhgly align with locations that oil drilling and fracking are occurring.  Further analysis is suggested.</p>
